  Build and publish the iHRIS-themed harness site (litlfred.github.io/ihris/):
  derive the theme from the verified release's own stylesheets, generate the
  landing board and the data-model pages from committed data, check every link
  and both viewports, and let the Pages workflow deploy it.

# Build the ihris site

Owner, 2026-09-23: the site is published from this repository and styled like iHRIS (Classic Manage), with the iHRIS logo credited under the GPL. The data-model pages follow the accepted wireframe H2 (`docs/design/wireframes/data-model-site/acceptance.json`).

## 1. Theme (Tool `ihris-extract-theme`)

```sh
python3 src/tools/extract_theme.py          # needs uploads/ihris-suite-4.3.3/*.tar.bz2
```

- It reads `globalStyles.css`, then `themeStyles.css`, in cascade order, and writes `src/site/theme/ihris-classic.json` (`ihris-site-theme/v1`) and the logo.
- Every token records the selector and file it was measured from.
- **Never hand-edit a colour.** Where a measured colour fails WCAG AA in its role, the tool picks another colour *measured from the same stylesheets* and records the reason in `adjustments`.
- To change the look, change the rules in the tool.

**The dark scheme (Tool `ihris-derive-dark-theme`).** The release has no dark stylesheet, so a dark palette cannot be measured. What a person decides is kept small and written down in `src/site/theme/ihris-classic-dark.grounds.json` (`ihris-site-theme-dark-grounds/v1`): how dark the grounds are, each on the hue of a measured colour, the WCAG targets, and how the logo is shown. The owner chose it through `wireframe-design-review` (`docs/design/wireframes/dark-scheme/`, 2026-10-09). Every other colour is derived into `src/site/theme/ihris-classic-dark.json`: it keeps its light role's hue and saturation and takes the lowest lightness that reaches its target on every ground. A new palette is a new round of that review, never a hand-edited colour.

```sh
python3 src/tools/derive_dark_theme.py            # after the light theme or the grounds change
```

## 2. Site (Tool `ihris-build-site`)

The generator is `src/tools/build_site.py`, with the data-model pages and chrome. `src/tools/site_instances.py` holds every other instance's pages. Licence decides what a page shows (AGENTS.md §2.4):
- GPL sources, modules, data lists and wiki pages: in full, with attribution.
- The toolkit: its text is published because its declaration records the owner's permission (2026-09-23). Without that record, it falls back to structure only. Its reader comments are never published.
- `iHRIS/ihris-documentation` (no licence): path and heading only.

```sh
python3 src/tools/build_site.py --out .build/site --check-links
```

- Everything is generated:
  - the landing board, from `ihris.json` and each instance's `<name>.json`;
  - one page per package and per class, from `src/*/data-model/4.3.3`;
  - `glossary/`, from `glossary/*.glossary.json` (skill `build-skos-glossary`), with each scheme's SKOS JSON-LD under `assets/glossary/`;
  - `data-model/search.html`, which searches the data model AND the glossary, at the data model's URL.
- Links are relative, so the site works under `/ihris/` and from a file.
- `_site/` is git-ignored. Never commit the output.

## 3. Check both viewports

Every page is checked for horizontal overflow at web 1280×800 and mobile 390×844. A page that overflows on either is a defect in the generator's CSS, not in the page. `validate.py` builds the site and fails on any broken link.

## 4. The folio chrome (Tool `ihris-rail-site`)

Every page carries the platform's chrome: the harness rail, its icon row, the Folio glass and the light/dark switch, the same on every folio a reader browses. It is added AFTER the build, never by the site generator, and it is the platform's own mechanism for a folio's own pages site, so there is one chrome and no second copy to drift. The chrome's code loads from the platform's published site; only the rail's data is written beside the pages.

The rail is **scoped to this folio**: it lists ihris and the harnesses it needs, never the platform's whole list (owner, 2026-10-09: "does not need to depend on smart-base or smart-trust"). The platform's harness data is regenerated from this checkout first, which writes inside the mounted platform layer: harmless in a throwaway build, and a local checkout remounts afterwards.

Check it in a browser, with the platform's own chrome check. The staging-banner check applies to previews only.

**The work plan is a page of this site** (Tools `ihris-gen-beans-data`, `ihris-own-site-links`). The navbar's beans icon opens it and carries the number of open beans, both THIS folio's, never the platform's: the board is the platform's own work-plan board, drawn from this folio's bean store with the platform's own functions, so it reads as it does on every folio. Two gaps in the platform's rail for a folio that is the root of its own site are bridged around the rail and recorded upstream (bean `ihris-yvow`); the bridge goes when they close.

**The chrome's mark is the iHRIS logo** (ihris.json `icon`, `images`): the logo for a dark ground, because the rail is dark in both schemes, written with the dark theme. The rail places a folio's own mark at the platform's address; the own-site-links bridge points it at this site (the same upstream gap).

**The light/dark switch decides the scheme** (Tool `ihris-scheme-css`). The dark colours are applied with the platform's own scheme functions, so the reader's choice wins and the OS decides only until they choose, and a page restores the reader's choice at first paint instead of flashing light first.

## 5. Publish (the `gh-pages` branch)

- The site is served from the **`gh-pages` branch**, which holds build output only.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` rebuilds it on every push to `main` and commits the result on top of `gh-pages`. When nothing changed, it makes no commit.
- One-time owner setting: **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `gh-pages` / (root)**.
- Never edit `gh-pages` by hand. Change the generator and let the workflow publish.
